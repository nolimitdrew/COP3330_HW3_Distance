# COP3330_HW3_Distance
Your task will be to create a class called Distance, in the files "distance.h" and "distance.cpp", which will involve a variety of operator overloads. A Distance object will store a quantity of distance, in terms of miles, yards, feet, and inches. You will overload some basic operators for use with these objects, including arithmetic, comparison, and insertion/extraction (I/O) operators. Note: These operations must work even for large distances (i.e. fairly large nubmers of miles) and should not overflow the capacity of the storage variables (ints) unless the actual number of miles is very close to the upper limit of int storage.
